# RPTS Simulation

Simulation code for the paper [Improving Particle Thompson Sampling through Regenerative Particles](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10089647) presented at 
the *57th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems, Baltimore, MD, USA*.

**Note**: The algorithm RPTS in the paper is implemented as RPTS-2 in the code. RPTS-1 in the code is another version
of the algorithm with a different covariance matrix for particle regeneration, which is not presented in the paper.
